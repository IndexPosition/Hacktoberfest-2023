Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

### Input Format

First line contains one integer x.

### Constraints

-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

### Output Format

Output true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

```
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```
